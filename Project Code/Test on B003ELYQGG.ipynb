The panasonic buds are hands down my favorite. They fit perfectly, they are not to big or to small. The alltec lansing I found to be too small so they feel out just like buds that are too big. The ifrogz are a close second to the panasonic, however because of the fit and the high quality of sound the panasonic are &#34;it&#34;. The noise cancellation ability of the panasonic is A+ and the sound quality was not sacrificed a bit as the connection of the earbuds to my mp3 player is &#34;spot on&#34;. It's like a personal concert in my ears!! It seems to have an equal balance of bass and trebile which makes for good sound quality. However the best part really is the earbuds ability to cancel out background noise. I suffer from seizures and these will be a great help in blocking out noises I DON'T want to hear, and pump in music I do want to hear. It tricks my brain into focusing on the music and not the background noise which tends to bring seizures on. These will be a great help!!!\",\n",

       "       \"I purchased this to replace a pair of JBuds J3s that I've been using for the past three years.  I sometimes fall asleep with my earbuds on so I must have yanked the wiring a little too hard while I slept and one side went dead.  Based on amazon reviews, I ordered a pair of Sennheiser CX 300B MK II and these Panasonic RPHJE120K to replace the JBuds.  I figured these Panasonics were cheap enough where I could wear them in bed and not worry too much.When I received my earbuds, I compared them to a Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia and a Skullcandy Smokin that I also had laying around.  I'm not an earbud aficionado so my comparison is only between these rather inexpensive choices.Not surprisingly, the Sennheiser, which was the most expensive of the four in the mid $30 range, sounded the best.  Its highs, lows, and even the mids were clear and audible.  It also required the lowest level of volume on my iphone for comfortable listening.To my surprise, the Panasonic RPHJE120K was not too far off in sound quality and was the cheapest of the four by far at around $7.  It didn't have the same level of clarity which was more noticeable in the highs but it was pretty good.  It still provided good bass response that was tight and not distorted even at higher volumes.  Without comparing these four earbuds side-by-side, I might not have noticed the difference between these Panasonics and the Sennheisers.  It required only one extra volume level to produce the same amount of output.I found the Skullcandy Smokin and Sony MDR-EX51LP to fall way behind in sound quality and it wasn't even close.  Maybe the best way to describe the difference is the Panasonic and especially the Sennheiser sounded like you were in the room with the musicians while the Skullcandy and Sonys sounded like the music was being played in the next room over.  The clarity was bad at all levels and you needed to crank the volume up to twice the level of the Sennheiser and Panasonic to get a similar output level.  While the Skullcandys had some bass, the Sony's were horrible.  I know people always mention that some reviewers must not be using the correct sized earpiece or are not positioning the earbuds correctly but believe me, I understand that and made sure they were all positioned in my ear for the optimal sound quality.  I used to use the Sonys prior to the JBuds and I never really thought the sound quality was that bad.  Without something better to compare it to I never knew what I was missing.Other things I liked about the Panasonic earbuds was that the cables do not transmit as much bumping and rubbing sounds as the Skullcandys and the JBud J3s that I had, maybe because the cables are thinner.  I also like that the earpieces are offset so I can easily distinguish the right from the left in the dark.  The earpiece is also oval shaped which seems to fit more comfortably in my ears.  The Sennheisers had better clarity and I'm sure there are other more expensive earbuds with better sound but all things considered, I think these Panasonic earbuds are an exceptional value for the price.  I plan to buy a pair for my wife and another as a my backup.\",\n",

The iLuv's are a much better fit (and I tried repositioning the headphones and using the different sizes of buds.  The iLuvs are louder with deeper bass.  These Panosonics are weak and you have to turn the volume high to get a decent response.  I don't know how there are thousands of reviews for these headphones and it shows an average of 4.5 stars?

I compared them to a set of cheap no-name headphones supplied by Dell with one of their peripherals; the Dell pair has a better bass response, but the treble end is a little muffled. I think a trade-off in sound quality is to be expected at this price point.It's good that they supply several different ear inserts - they will make it easy to fit any ear canal. The earpiece is slightly offset from the speaker, and I think that makes them more balanced and keeps them snugly in the ear instead of working loose.This item is priced about right for a general purpose headset if you don't need completely accurate sound reproduction, but need a bright clear sound - like when you are working out.

Ever since I bought a pair of the SCI headphones on sale, I've stuck with SCI until I lost my last pair recently. I bought the red version of these headphones and they do the job. The best way I can explain these headphones is having a pair of SCI headphones with a little bit better sound quality, more comfort (for me at least) and cheaper feel. They don't hurt my ears after wearing them for a while like the SCI heaphones did and I think it's because of the way the actual ear piece is shaped (looks like a short kids sippy cup to me). They come with extra ear cushions in case you have Dumbo ears and are really light weight. Another important feature I will mention is the connection end of the headphones are L shaped. Now I've always had a straight connection to my heaphones and the L shape doesn't bother me (think I might like it better).

But the little soft pads block outside sound nicely, so I never need to have them turned up much to begin with. The bass is solid and seems balanced in volume to the treble. I'm not sure if the bass gets heavier the louder you have them, but at lower volumes it's pretty 'natural'.It has REALLY CLEAR treble! Or &#34;highs&#34;, or whatever you call it - I'm hearing things in my music that I never heard before. In particular, I first noticed some very high-pitched chimes or bells in a Yoko Kanno song that I never even knew were in the piece, before these headphones. It was such a treat to hear that! And really, everything has much more clarity than my old ones (some Nintendo earbuds).They seem pretty solidly constructed. I've accidentally yanked 'em a few times, with no ill effects.

To get the free shipping, I decided to get these given the great reviews.By this point, my j2s and j3s had died. I had been using JVC xtreme xplosives to replace them. While I thought the j3s I had were perfect, the xtreme xplosives reminded me of the bass I had been missing.Over time, I've grown accustomed to wanting both. The j3s had clear mids and highs, but performed poorly in the bass (again, at the time, I thought it was adequate). The xtreme xplosives sacrificed some mids quality for lots of bass.Now, on arrival of my new sets of headphones (earlier today), I was eager to try the j4s I ordered.

I listened to a variety of music with these phones and found them to have too high of a treble response and very little bass response, added that a raspy sound.

Be a smart consumer for cryin-out-loud. If you are shopping for high-end earbuds, TRY these first. They might be all you need and you can keep the extra $90+.They're inexpensive, they sound pretty damn great, and they're comfortable.

Now that I've had a chance to use this Panasonic earphone I've come to the conclusion that most of the 5-star ratings is mainly due to its price right around $7. At this price, I don't know if you can do better than this. Of course, if you have more money to spend then you can find much, much, much better quality than this. The sound quality is definitely a notch or two lower than the IPhone 5/5s earbuds. In fact, the Panasonic is not in the same league. But then again, this is only $7. So buyers, lower your expectations on this headphone.The earbuds fit inside my ears more securely than the iPhone earbuds. However, after a while it starts to bother my ears. I can wear the iPhone earbuds all night (in fact I fall asleep with them on). But the Panasonic earbuds cause pain in my ears after about 30 minutes.  Of course, this may be different for other folks' ears. Yes, the Panasonic comes with 3 different size earbud attachments. Chances are that one of the three earbuds will be comfortable to 70%, 80%, or maybe 90% of the general public. But for me, its not comfortable. Definitely fits securely in the ear, but not comfortable.Also, I can hear movement coming from the earbud cable and earpiece. What I mean by this is, when I have these earbuds on and I'm doing some task such as walking, I can hear the cable bouncing around and the earpiece moving slightly inside my ears. Its very annoying. Again, I don't have this problem with my iPhone earbuds. I think I will dish out more money and go back to the iPhone earbuds.\",\n",

I had another pair of earbuds that ALWAYS fell out of my ears and had really tinny sound.

Great reviews and they cost &#60; $7.  I was intrigued.  I opened the page and saw a picture of the earbuds.  They looked curiously similar to my broken ones.  After doing a little bit of digging, I realized it was the same exact pair.  Hardly expensive!  I bought 3 pairs just in case.

       "       \"I'm puzzled by the overwhelming praise of these. Sure they're very inexpensive, but they're also really cheap. I suppose at this price point, the majority of the 5 star reviewers are unlikely to be used to the sound and quality of much better products. I guess I should admit I've used a variety of much more expensive ones including Etymotic, Shure and Ultimate Ears. But I still think there is some sort of weird group-think dynamic happening here. So I offer up my much more critical review.I guess some are impressed by lots of bass, but the bass from these is honestly muddy and there's too just much of it. There's no tightness or clarity in the low end- it's like the 80hz bass knob is cranked to the max. As for the rest of the frequency range, they are fully acceptable, and I'd go so far as to say they're good, especially for the $.But overall, aside from one or two sets of ear buds I've tried which were totally unacceptable, these pale in comparison just about everything else I've used. My old favorite budget buds are an old pair of discontinued Sony MDR EX70's I believe those were in the mid $30 range a few years back. The Sony's have strong bass, but it is clean. They've lasted me over 10 years. I recently picked up a pair of MEElectronics M6-CL-MEE (as I write this $16.99, I believe I paid closer to $12.99) which blow these out of the water in nearly every way- much cleaner and much more balanced top to bottom. They also offer much better construction, come with a zippered carrying case with a compartment for the extra ear buds, have a clothing clip and a sliding binder to keep them tangle free, and tight on the back of your head (they wrap over the ear to keep them in place, IEM / sport style). The cord on the MEE's is much better quality and more tangle resistant. The cord on these Panasonic's is about as cheap as I've seen- it reminds me of the disposable ones you get on airplanes. These do fit fairly well and are easier to insert than the MEE's, but the hard plastic angled body is a bit uncomfortable against my ears. The smaller Sony buds are so soft and comfortable that I can sleep on my side with them in and barely feel them. It'd be silly compare these to any of the $100 plus models I have, except to say that none of them is perfect either (two are a little light on bass, one is fantastic sounding but I can't wear them for more than an hour).Some have said these are the best of the super cheap buds, and I can accept that. If you tear up or lose your buds frequently, these might be the ticket. But if you are looking for good sound, quality, and can spend a little more, you'd probably be better off.Given the moderately decent sound at such a cheap price point,  I'd probably give them one more star if they had a better cord that didn't tangle so easily, the packaging (welded blister-pack which was quite difficult to cut open) didn't suck so bad. Also changing rubber tips stinks on these- much harder than any other bud I've used.\",\n",
       "       \"This ear-bud set came with smaller and larger size earpieces that I could use, but the ones installed worked fine for me (a 6-foot woman with a proportionately slightly larger head and possibly slightly larger ear openings than shorter people, I suppose). Sound quality is clear, and sound transmission from device via the ear-buds to my ears is excellent. They don't fall out if you use them while walking and running around. Nice long extension cord, and they fit easily into the standard headphone jack on my smartphone and laptop. If you want to adjust the sound, you adjust it on the device these plug into, not on the ear-bud assembly itself (this is a cheap, simple transmission device only). Great product for the price.

Those whom can\\'t describe the design, if you have seen the newer versions of \"ear buds\" they are shaped so it fits in your ear completely. No lose fit. Basically unlike the iPod ones where overall its the complete structure of the bud, this only uses a portion to the front nearest to your ear canal to put the music straight into your ear. They come with different sizes. I use the smallest so it fits snug and not hurt my ears. Have had them in about 1 1/2 hour(s) making a commute in public transportation and had no people looking at me as if to loud of an output and never hurt my ears. The sound is clean. I really don\\'t want treble or bass to hit in my ear as it\\'s more of a close sound unlike a surround sound or car speakers. So i look for Vocals and sound height. This is close to perfect. I use it with my Android Phone to listen to my music and have no problems at all. I can\\'t speak to say treble and bass as i am not big on saying how good it sounds, but this is rich in voice out put. From Maroon 5 to Dr. Dre the music comes out crisp and clean.

But i hate the Packaging!Those giving three for comfort i don\\'t think should be putting rating down due to there type of ear.

Specially if you subscribe to amazon prime and can get these shipped to your house in 2 days for $6.50 that is a great deal for these headphones.One thing that is different from how it is advertised is that probably half of the pictures displayed / uploaded by buyers show the headphones as being essentially the same for each ear with the squishy plastic part in the middle of the head phone (the soft plastic in ear part is directly in the center of the hard plastic part of the headphone) while for the ones that I was shipped the squishy plastic part is offset from the hard plastic part in a way that allows it to fit in your ear well. I like the offset way better personally so I was happy about this (although I didn't expect it or know that I would like it better this way initially), because my maybe goofy ears sometimes have trouble with in ear headphones falling out of my ear or needing to be shoved in there just right while these I don't think have fallen out of my ears ever yet (probably listed to 7-10 hours of music with them so far).All in all I liked the design but be aware it might be slightly different than pictured (if requested I might be willing to upload a picture of how mine look if its confusing to you). The sound is spectacular for a 6 dollar pair of headphones, I haven't experienced any cracking really while my old cheap headphones could hardly handle any bass. I almost bought some 50-100 dollar head phones until my cheapness kicked in and I went with these and I am really happy that I did as they sound great at least as far as I'm concerned (I'm not an audiophile who spend tons of money on audio accessories).I try not to give out too many 5 star reviews but I can't complain with the current price tag and free 2 day prime shipping.I will update this review if I encounter any problems so if you see this review without an &#34;Edit:&#34; at the end then that means I am still loving them just as much.\",\n",

The shape of the speaker portion fits very comfortably, which is a big win...I absolutely hate the iPhone 5 headphones, since the hard plastic hurts my ears, and I like a set of earbuds that provides some isolation from the outside world, and these fit the bill.  They are more comfortable than the previous Sony set I had, which is the best I've used.The sound quality is fantastic.  As typical of in-ear buds, there is great bass reproduction...

(I can remember him telling me how much he liked the bass on these, and they were on par with $20-$30 earbuds he's owned in the past.)

Strong bass and good volume control for such an inexpensive pair of ear buds.I regularly like wearing street style headphones while working out in the gym, but recently they started playing the music too loud and my old headphones didn't block out enough sound. Although these are not noise cancelling, because of the ergonomic design and the varying ear plug sizes provided in the packaging, these earbuds go all the way into your ear, helping block a considerable amount of outside noise so you don't have to make yourself go deaf to not hear everyone else's crap in the gym.That said please don't play them too loud as they are significantly closer to your ear and can do more damage. As I said though, I usually hated earbuds because they never stayed in my ear. These sometimes don't stay in my ear, but only because the cord is two inches too short for me.I am six foot tall and I like to keep my MP3 player in my pocket while I run, and this results in the cord occasionally tugging the earbuds out of my ears.Other than the cord length (which is more of a personal issue for me and only a problem while running) these are solid headphones and I would recommend them to any earbud fan.

I was blown away by the sound though.  I am a bass fiend, and these do not disappoint.  I put on the smallest of the earplugs that came with the buds.  They allow me to fit them into my ears snugly, but comfortably.  I could wear these all day long.Granted, I am not a young man, so perhaps my hearing is not as acute as it once was, but I know what I like.  I was recently at the mall, and listened to two different models of Beats Audio headphones, curious of what the fuss was about.

So when I came across these for $8- the reviews were decent and I figured they were cheap enough that if they were really bad I wouldn't be out too much money. After receiving them I was pleasantly surprised. They sounded just as good as the Sony's (maybe slightly lacking in the bass). The only thing lacking on these Panasonic's was the volume control on the wire, but I use these with a computer so I can easily adjust the volume with a few quick keyboard strokes. I can also wear these all day and I don't get any ear pain- which I wish I could say the same about the Apple earbuds... Now I don't know how these compare to the $50-$200 earbuds, but I can't image with drivers this small that there is really that much discernible difference.

However, they are not that hard to untangle, and I keep going back to the clear sound and nice sound isolation that make these sound really nice.  At this price, it is worth buying multiple pairs and lowering the stress in your life - they are so cheap that you won't panic of you lose or damage a pair, and you can afford to leave some scattered about so you are not always hunting for them.  I bought 3 so far, in different colors, and have some for wearing while cutting grass, working out, or listening to my laptop.  If you are looking for studio quality sound, then go drop a few hundred bucks more on another brand, but if you are looking for something for the gym, goofing around, or casual listening, you can't go wrong with these.

I use earbuds at the gym, on a plane, even when mowing the lawn. What I look for are buds that comfortably fit my ears, help quiet the outside world and have good sound quality, in all three areas these Panasonics meet my expectations.I really like the fit, though since they are asymmetric you have to pay attention as to which bud goes into which ear, a minor extra step but worth it when they're in. They sound surprisingly crisp though they don't replace my AKGs that I use at home, these are for the gym, they get abused so I cut them some slack. What I'm not fond of is the cord; its a fairly flimsy affair and its what costs them that extra star. Its not bad, its just not as sturdy as others that I've tried. It also lacks the little slider that some earbuds have that keep the ends together when not in use. Again, not a big deal when on however the lack of it does make it easier for them to become tangled. Too bad.Look, for the price you are not going to get high end audiophile sound, no, these are the pair that you're going to abuse; they are going to get sweaty, wet, dirty and tossed around with little regard.

The bass is clean and fast (though not all that powerful), and the treble is reasonably sparkling.  The cord, which is color-matched to the body, looks nice. For the price, amazing.Comfort:  my ears were itching pretty badly after about 30 minutes of use.  I\\'m accustomed to in-ear monitors, so this was unusual.  I discovered that removing and rinsing the earcups took care of this.  They may use some sort of cleaning chemical or similar.  Now they are comfortable.  So if you run into this problem, try removing and rinsing the earcups and try again.These are not for bass-heads, but you can EQ up the bass and they put out the extra energy without distorting, so it\\'s not that they lack OK bass ability.  I own a pair of Sennheiser CX300s with *significantly* more powerful bass and would recommend them to bass fans.  BUT, in truth I prefer the audio balance of these, because the midrange is not depressed relative to bass and treble, which brings out nice detail in vocals and instruments, and not incidentally some nice \"kick\" in percussion edges.My take is, buy a few pairs of these and leave one in your desk at work, one in the bag, one in your room, etc. and always have a spare pair handy in case you forget/lose/break your primary pair.

Moreover, the judgment is always necessarily highly \"subjective\" and relative to listeners\\' personal tastes.  If it\\'s not a blindfold test, the preference may come down to listeners\\' susceptibility to makers\\' promotional material, the added \"designer-quality\" features (including packaging), and lots of elitist hype supported by technological jargon based on physics and acoustic principles.Oddly, listeners tend to disregard the source material and its limitations, regardless of the technology of the transducers (i.e. phones or speakers) used to reproduce the frequencies of the source material.  Yet, more often than not, the source material is compressed to the size of an mp3 file with a bit rate of 128 kbps as compared to a non-compressed WAV or AIFF file of 1411 kbps.  So unlike the high fidelity systems of the 1970s--AR3 vs. KLH \"sealed\" speakers vs. McIntosh and JBL combinations of woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters in a single gigantic cabinet--all designed to transmit the \"non-compressed\" signal embedded in the grooves of a long-playing record--the \"stakes\" in today\\'s audio comparison/shoot-outs are far lower and less significant.  Instead of \"which system can reproduce the full frequency spectrum?\", the question has been reduced, merely, to which system sounds best while translating the limited information of an MP3 file into sound that is most pleasing to the perception of the listener?With practice and with certain types of music that has been recorded by certain engineers, I\\'m now able to distinguish between Apple Lossless compression (files of 768 kbps) and common MP3 files (128 Kbps), but the perceived difference is neither habit-forming nor behavior- changing.  I\\'m still inclined to go with whatever \"sounds best\" to my ears.  Invariably, I\\'m impressed by the phones or speakers that, to my sensibilities, best represent the \"sounds in nature,\" ie., the actual, pure and non-distorted, non-altered sounds of instruments recorded individually and in ensemble contexts as well as the complete range of the male and female human singing voice.  But when listening to an engineer like Rudy Van Gelder, who distorts the sound of the piano and enhances the sound of horns to offer the listener clearest access to all of the instruments being recorded, the headphones or speakers can do little to rectify the imbalances found in the source material.  It\\'s when listening to the engineers who recorded \"Kind of Blue\" at Columbia Records or to the recordings of Roy Dunann for Contemporary Records that my ears perceive the truest, most \"natural,\" deepest and most complex sound of an instrument, or instruments, or the human voice--IN SPACE.  Without regard to \"context\" (or what some listeners refer to as \"ambiance\") there is no longer a standard of reference, or a \"sound in nature,\" which necessarily will have 3-dimensional realism, or depth.  Instead, the sound is manufactured and altered long before being picked up by various amplifying speakers in earphones, headphones, or elaborate speaker systems.In the case of these Panasonic phones (costing $5) and the Sony phones (costing $10--though there are times when the prices are reversed, depending upon matters such as color and supply-demand), the consumer can be prepared to hear full-fidelity music, with clear reproduction of textures and pitches, from the double bass through the piano (and its overtones) through a percussion kit (including bass drum, snares, crash and ride cymbals, and the hi-hat\\'s \"chic chic\" sound on the off-beats), to the human voice itself (in this instance, Roberta Gambarini\\'s).I compared the two phones with each other as well as with phones in the $50-$100 area (Sony MDR-EX300LP, Altec Titanium Backbeat UHP326) and phones in the $200 area (Sony MDR-EX700LP).  I suspect that the latter phones not only \"wear longer\" (due to better construction, thicker cords, etc.) but \"wear better\" (I can listen to music for several hours without any sense of discomfort or mounting pressure in the ear).  But as far as initial impressions go, the sonic differences are too small (and subjective) to be worthy of mention. The Sony phones are very slightly smaller and more lightweight, which may account for my sense that the music I was hearing from the Panasonics had fuller textures and more body, especially in the mid-range.  To put it differently: with the Sony phones I was hearing music played with stunning, pristine clarity while standing at the BACK of the music room;  with the Pansonic phones, I was down front, practically a hostage to the crack of the drummer\\'s sticks, the pedaled overtones of the piano, the bassist\\'s articulation of the strings (not merely the bass\\'s tones).  Very likely, the same effect could be achieved with the Sony phones by using smaller ear tips (for a tighter seal) and turning up the gain (the Panasonic earphones are a trifle more \"efficient\"--i.e. sensitive--than the Sony phones, which require turning up the volume to reproduce the same resonating textures.  The Panasonics use a special, \"ergonomic\" angle along with an \"angular\" tip that ensures deeper insertion of the tip into the ear canal, thus accounting for some of the added \"body\" I was hearing in the sounds of the instruments and vocals.  Some listeners many prefer the more conventional ear tips of the Sony phones.  (Both phones provide two additional sets of tips, which are, in both cases, constructed with a stiff center, along the lines of Sony\\'s acclaimed \"hybrid silicone ear-tips\").I\\'d recommend ordering these Panasonic phones for $5-6.  If you like them, order another set before they wear out and the price goes up.  If you don\\'t, order the Sony phones and keep the Panasonics on hand for the inevitable day that they fail (providing you don\\'t accidentally step on them first).[Ignore the aficionados\\' advice to \"burn in\" the phones, even before wearing them.  Even with high-end, costly phones, that\\'s merely reducing the average lifetime of the phones for listening.  Moreover, either of these ultra low-priced Panasonic or Sony phones is ready to go into action from the moment you extract a pair from the box.  (Feel free to ignore the crumpled up instructions and warranty.)]',\n",

With the panasonic headphones you will almost forget they are in your ears.  The rubber pieces make a good deal in your ear and sound great.  The bass is so good it sounds like they are mini subwoofers.  The only minor complaints is the long wire is a bit thin and can get tangled twisted a lot easier than the stock iphone headphones.  Also the part that connects into the headphone jack would not fit properly because of my iphone case.  So what I did was I got a knife and cut the rubber a little bit higher making the headphone jack a little longer and exposing more of the metal jack.  Worked like a charm!

The cushion-like pads on the end can be easily cleaned; the speakers themselves won't get dirty (as with Apple earbuds).Simply put, these are a great deal.

But here are the 2 deal breakers for me:(1) The treble causes figurative ear bleeding. And if I were to use them regularly, I suspect they might cause literal ear bleeding. There was something about the treble that just hurts my ears like crazy. It was extremely raw.(2) At the same time, everything sounds distant/tin canny.

These are still outstanding headphones for the money.Edit as of 04/28/2013These headphones are still awesome but I've found that they fall out of my ears too easily when I am jogging.  I am going to try the larger sized plugs to see if this will correct the problem and will update accordingly.Pros:-They fit my ears perfectly (they come with 3 different sizes.-The shape of the headphones fits snuggly in my ears.-The base is nice and low (no distortion) and the sound is very clear (I use a Sansa Fuze)-You can't beat the price.Cons:-The cord gets tangled.Overall: By far the best headphones I've purchased.  I use these when I cut the grass, jog, workout, and relax.\",\n",
       "       \"The way these fit into the ear is different.  I find that I can keep them in for extended periods of time without my ears feeling soar.  The sound is amazing!  And for the price... well, I haven't found its equal.\",\n",
       "       'I have 5 of these of various colors and purposes. These fit perfectly in my ears and are incredibly comfortable for me. I use them for everything especially for running and working out. They don\\'t fall out like others I have owned (Koss with foamies, JVCs of a similar design, and Sony in-ear buds to name a few). I have listened to the popular \"Beats by Dre\" in-ear buds and still think these Panasonics sound great plus they\\'re cheap as heck. I have a Bose ON-Ear head set that sound awesome and these little Panasonic buds are almost as good but more convenient.',\n",
       "       \"I'm not an audiophile, so I can't attest to the audio quality of these earphones. However, I have had a lot of trouble in the past with getting earphones to stay in a good position in my ears while I'm walking or biking, especially with the terrible ones that used to come with Apple products. However, these fit quite comfortably and securely, and they sound great! The noise isolation isn't the best, but I can hear my audiobooks and podcasts quite clearly even in the noisy NYC subway stations. If these had a built-in mic, this would be the perfect smartphone companion.\",\n",
       "       \"These headphones sound better than most I have bought for over $50, but they are made of poor quality materials and they hurt the inside of my ears (due to the construction of the piece that intrudes the ear).  It is not a typical circular sphere that enters your ears when you put these on, but more like an oval shape that stands tall and presses against your ear.  Maybe I have small ears canals or something, but these hurt after 15 minutes and I'd rather not wear these if I have the choice.  Awesome sound, very uncomfortable.\",\n",
       "       'But the price is hard to beat.  The real test will be reliability.  If it breaks I will update this.  It goes in my ears great.',\n",
       "       \"I've been using these for the past month and absolutely love them. These Panasonic earphones are so comfortable and easy on my ears. I have small ear canals and I've tried many other earphones, the more expensive branded ones, and have been disappointed time and again until I tried these on. The earpads are soft and can easily be molded to fit into my ears. The pack also comes with three pairs of soft earpads in sizes S, M, and L for convenience. The sound quality is quite good for the price and since I'm more about comfort, these fit the bill. They also come in many colors - I got the pink, and love them.\",\n",
       "       \"I'll start off by saying that I HATE EARBUDS!! I have oddly shaped ears so I generally use actual headphones. However, as a college student, I needed something more versatile and less heavy, also something easy to put away and take out quick. So I bought earbuds.The Good:-The color. It's nice and pink, just as shown.-The sound--ish. They sound pretty good. Not amazing, but not horrible. (keep in mind you'll be paying under 10 bucks, not 50 so you can expect less than amazing quality)-They stay in the jack. My other headphones always slip from my phone jack. These haven't slipped ONCE, which is great.The Bad:-The odd shape that's supposed to go in your ear. Don't be fooled (like I was) the round clearish-gray bulb you see to the left of the pink back on the earbud IS NOT ROUND, it is oblong shaped. The clear plastic (oblong shaped) bulb comes off and they give you 2 other sizes (3 sizes. Large, medium, small) I'm using the small ones because I have oddly shaped ears. They don't really sit in my ears right, if it's windy, they will fall out my ear. It's pretty difficult for me to get them in my ears right.-If you want earbuds that you can blast without people hearing you listening to the Pokemon theme song, you might not want these. People can hear what you're listening to. I tried them at different levels and asked my sister if she could name the songs I'm listening to. She named just about everything, just not when it was ridiculously low.Overall, I don't like them. They have amazing reviews so maybe it's just me; keep in mind that I already hate earbuds and have irregular shaped ears. If you really want to try them, by all means, do it! It's not the end of the world; they're pretty cheap.\",\n",
       "       \"For around $6.00 these are a good deal.  They don't sound quite as good as my Sony MDR-EX210B headset (which cost around $18), but they sound pretty decent.  They are a good snug fit in my ears, and they definitely blow away the horrible headphones Apple includes with the Iphone (Apple should be ashamed of itself for selling such a terrible sounding headset with their famed Iphone!), so if you're looking for a really cheap-but-great sounding upgrade to the Apple headphones for listening to music, these definitely are that.  Also I wish the cord was a bit longer on the Panasonic RPHJE120 since I like to plug them into my home computer and use them to monitor while I sing into a mic.  The cord is a bit too short for that, but for listening while you're walking, running, etc it's just fine.  BOTTOM LINE:  Honestly I'd still rather spend a little more to get the Sonys, which have a punchier, more well defined bass than these Panasonic headphones do, and a bit longer cord.  To me it's worth the extra $12 to get the nicer sounding pair.  That said, for around $6.00 I don't think you'll find a headset which sounds as good as these do.\",\n",
       "       \"For the price, these headphones are phenomenal! I thought it was wierd that the headphone rubber tip is not centered on the headphone piece but it ends up fitting nicely into my ears and is quite comfortable. As a public transit commuter, I like to own a cheap pair of headphones that can drown out the everyday noise and still provide me with good quality tunes, and I think these headphones definitely fit the bill!! Will definitely order another pair again! Hopefully, I won't have to and they survive me some time =P\"], dtype=object)"
